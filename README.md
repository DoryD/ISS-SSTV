# ISS-SSTV
Pretty cool, right? With a little know how and some solder anyone can do this!

#### First, the antenna.
Your antenna will be the most important part of receiving signals, so let's start there. 

Hands down the easiest antenna for this job is going to be [Adam 9A4QV's V dipole](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6fpfn2p9filc9ol/DIY%20137MHz%20WX-sat%20V-dipole%20antenna.pdf?dl=0) 

(from rtl-sdr.com) 
>"The idea is that by arranging a dipole into a horizontal ‘V’ shape, the radiation pattern will be directed skywards in a figure 0 (zero) pattern. This will be optimal for satellites travelling in front, above and behind the antenna. Since polar orbiting satellites always travel North to South or vice versa, we can take advantage of this fact simply by orienting the antenna North/South."

There is a lot of technical information in that document, but all you really need is this image to get started <img src=https://www.rtl-sdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/adams_V-dipole-500x375.png>
Connect the centre part of the coax to one leg, and the sheilding to the other, spread apart 120° and secure it in place.
